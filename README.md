myContacts App ver 1.0
That's the first app I created using Angular. Was tough at the beginning but eventually I enjoyed the ride :-)



Something to mention

Contact data comes from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
Requests are also made to this fake REST API. Since each added new contact gets an ID of 11 (as you cannot change their database in reality) deleting newly added users is malfunctioning - all of them are removed at once because deleting is based on ID
Need to add the validation for the forms
Working on version with router
Suggestions welcome b.bombelka@gmail.com

Test the App here https://bbombelka.github.io/myContacts/
